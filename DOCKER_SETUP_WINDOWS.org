* Install Docker

  Docker Toolbox is for older Windows systems. Docker Desktop for Windows is a
  newer application, however it uses Hyper-V, which does not allow container
  device access, so Docker Toolbox will be used instead.

** Check Virtualization Enabled

   1. Launch a command prompt or Windows PowerShell window.
   2. Enter the command given below:

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        systeminfo.exe
      #+END_SRC

   3. Wait few seconds (It takes a few seconds to gather information about your
      system but then gives you a result)
   4. Look under Hyper-V Requirements.
   5. See that Virtualization Enabled In Firmware reads Yes or that 'A
      hypervisor has been detected'.
   6. If Virtualization has not been enabled, restart the computer and enable
      virtualization in BIOS or UEFI.

** Uninstall Docker Desktop if Necessary

   1. Go to Settings > Apps on your Windows 10 machine.
   2. Under Apps & Features, find Docker for Windows.
   3. Go to Docker for Windows > Uninstall.

** Uninstall VirtualBox if Necessary

   1. Go to Settings > Apps on your Windows 10 machine.
   2. Under Apps & Features, find VirtualBox
   3. Go to VirtualBox > Uninstall.

** Disable Hyper-V if Necessary

   1. Open an elevated PowerShell Command Prompt window.
   2. At the command prompt, run the following command:

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor
      #+END_SRC

   3. Restart computer to take effect.

** Check to Make Sure Hyper-V is Disabled

   1. In Control Panel, select Programs and Features.
   2. Select Turn Windows features on or off.
   3. Expand Hyper-V, expand Hyper-V Platform, and then make sure Hyper-V
      Hypervisor check box is cleared.

** Install VirtualBox

   1. Download latest VirtualBox and Extension Pack

      [[https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads][VirtualBox Downloads]]

   2. Install VirtualBox with all features.
   3. Install Extension Pack

** Install Docker Toolbox

   1. To download the latest version of Docker Toolbox, go to
      [[https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases][Toolbox Releases]] and
      download the latest .exe file.
   2. Install Docker Toolbox by double-clicking the installer.
   3. Uncheck VirtualBox and proceed
   4. Uncheck “View Shortcuts in File Explorer” and press Finish.

** Verify Docker Toolbox Installation

   1. On your Desktop, find the Docker QuickStart Terminal icon.
   2. Click the Docker QuickStart icon to launch a pre-configured Docker Toolbox
      terminal.
   3. Type the docker run hello-world command and press RETURN.

** Setup VirtualBox Machine

   1. Stop the boot2docker vm:

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        docker-machine stop default
      #+END_SRC

   2. Open VirtualBox manager and change settings on default
   3. Increase display virtual memory to 16 MB
   4. Use VMSVGA graphics controller
   5. Enable USB 2.0 controller
   6. Start the boot2docker vm:

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
        docker-machine start default
      #+END_SRC

** Start a Priviledged Docker Container

   Since the USB devices are connected to the boot2docker VM, the commands need
   to be run from that machine. Open up a terminal with the VM and run the
   Docker run command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     docker-machine ssh
     docker run -it --privileged -v /dev:/dev ubuntu bash
   #+END_SRC
